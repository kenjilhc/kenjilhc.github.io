  <p> Established in 1911, the University of Western Australia is home to over 20,000 students. To cater for the increasing amount of students, <abbr title="The University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr> has invested in many facilities spread around their main campus situated in Crawley, Western Australia. These include study spaces and libraries to enhance the study experience. More facilities include multiple coffee shops and food courts to give students access to very affordable food when they are on campus. </p>

  <h3> Problem Identification </h3>
  <p> With several hundreds of students using these food facilities on a daily basis, the waste produced on campus is considerable. Despite efforts to recycle what can be recycled, a lot of organic waste is still being sent out to landfills every couple of days. On the long term, this not only means the university loses the opportunity to upcycle the organic waste into compost but the carbon footprint from sending out the trucks which then go to the landfills will always be on the increase. Moreover, with the many gardens found on campus and around, it is simply a missed opportunity to access cheap compost. Therefore, should composting be successful on campus, it would not only help <abbr title="The University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr> move towards a more environmental sustainable future, but also an economic one.</p>

  <h3> Aim of this project </h3>
  <p> The goal of this project is to investigate and determine the plausibility of investing into composting facilities on university grounds in the coming future. Over the next two years, university student-researchers will be looking into introducing the concept of smart composting on the Crawley campus. The project includes collecting data, brainstorming ideas and producing prototypes for the system mentionned above. Once the prototypes are completed and a final design approved, the project will undergo an investment analysis to determine if the University of Western Australia can, in fact, push forward the concept into a product.</p>

  <h3> Benefits of this project, if successful </h3>
  <p> As a primary benefit, the volume of waste being sent out to landfills will be lower and the compost produced will be able to be used on campus itself. With less waste being thrown away, the frequency at which garbage trucks will ned to be dispatched for collection should see a decrease too. This helps lower the carbon footprint of not only the university, but also that of other nearby businesses which would like to participate. Should the amount of compost being produced be very large, the university will also be looking at saving in terms of groundskeeping costs. Moreover, excess compost can simply be donated to local community gardens and councils. </p>
  <p> Therefore, benefits of this project, should it be a success, would not only be environmental and economic but it would also benefit the local communities. </p>
