  <p> Established in 1911, the University of Western Australia is home to over 20,000 students. To cater for the increasing amount of students, <abbr title="The University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr> has invested in many facilities spread around their main campus situated in Crawley. These include study spaces and libraries to enhance the student study experience. More facilities include the multiple coffee shops and food courts to give students access to very affordable food when they are on campus. </p>

  <h3> Problem Identification </h3>
  <p> With several hundreds of students using these food facilities on a daily basis, the waste produced on campus is considerable. Despite efforts to recycle what can be, a lot of organic waste is still sent out to landfills every couple of days. On the long term, this not only means the university loses the opportunity to upcycle the organic waste into compost but the carbon footprint from sending out the trucks and to the landfills is always on the increase. Moreover, with the many gardens found on campus and around, it is a considerable missed opportunity to have access to cheap compost. Therefore, should composting be successful on campus, it would not only help <abbr title="The University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr> move towards a more environmental sustainable future, but also an economic one.

  <h3> Aim of this project </h3>
  <p> The goal of this project is to investigate and determine the plausibility of investing into composting facilities on university grounds. Over the next two years, university student-researchers will be looking into the introducing the concept of smart composting on the Crawley campus. The project includes collecting data, brainstorming ideas and producing prototypes for the system mentionned above. Once the prototypes are completed and a final design approved, the project will undergo an investment analysis to determine if the University of Western Australia can, in fact, push forward the concept into a product.
